Understanding proteins are the route to combatting diseases and accessing new modes of green chemistry. We have made great strides to understand how they work, but our understanding falls shorts of a routine and reliable ability to edit them to better suit our needs and those of the planet. The Protein Machinists lab works towards a vision where re-engineering a protein to alter, improve or remove its properties is simply step one of a much bigger project, so we can focus on solving real-world problems.

We have naturally occuring enzymes which can degrade our waste back to stock materials, but an enzyme is not suitable for industry without optimal stability, pH, temperature range, substrate specificity and catalytic turnover. Source organisms often select for sub-efficiency to regulate flow through metabolic pathways. We can either wait for the perfect enzyme to come along, or make it ourselves.

In order to make these kinds of changes, we need to have more than just an appreciation of the static structure of a protein. Without protein dynamics, there is no chemistry and no biology. Proteins are highly sensitive to even sub-0.1 Ã… changes in their base structure and dynamics. This requires a sensitive parameter space to make these kinds of calls, which is why this lab works in torsion angle space.
