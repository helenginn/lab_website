This work is underpinned by the use of torsion angles to understand protein dynamics, as implemented in RoPE. RoPE clusters related protein structures on torsion angles, allowing different conformational states to be revealed mathematically. This work relies on the Vagabond algorithm for optimising torsion angles and cluster4x for clustering on torsion angle differences.
