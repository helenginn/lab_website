The Protein Machinists lab is led by Dr. Helen Ginn. She is a Helmholtz Young Investigator at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, DESY. She has delivered the software suite Vagabond for refining protein structures in torsion angle space and cluster4x for comparing related crystal structures. She also has a scientific background in virology, working on the immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 variants and structural biology efforts against foot-and-mouth disease virus. Her doctorate was spent in reciprocal space at the University of Oxford working on improved algorithms for data reduction for serial crystallography. Her hobbies include dress-making, leathercraft and blacksmithing.
